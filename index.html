        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
            At Taco Bell, we’ve had innovation on our mind since Glen Bell started serving tacos at the first location in 1962 in Downey, California. Since then, we’ve grown to be a culture-centric, lifestyle brand that provides craveable, affordable Mexican-inspired food with bold flavors. Not only do we provide breakthrough value, we offer quality ingredients and are the first QSR restaurant to offer American Vegetarian Association (AVA)-certified menu items

Outside of our restaurants, fans can access Taco Bell through our mobile app, desktop on Ta.co and delivery through our partnership with Grubhub. Taco Bell became the first QSR to launch a mobile app in U.S. restaurants for both drive-thru and dining orders. In 2016, we were named as one of Fast Company’s Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in the World.
